Right about where I am at with week 5 and what went well and what could have gone better.


So far this week we have gone from "how do i use a databse?" and "What does it to?"

What is a Databse?
A database is a big bubble of information which can consist of anything. Something, somewhere is always getting data from something. An example of this is everyday life. for this instance, if you want to go and turn on your computer, you will need to plug it into the plug socket. 

- the plug socket needs electricity
- the electricity is coming from the electric company
- the electric company is getting their electricity from its main source

the database in this sense would be the source of where the electric company is getting/generating their electricity from then keeping all of the data(electricity) required to send it to our homes through wiring to our streets.

Another more simplistic example is via the internet. Whenever you login to a website, check your email or even just load a site, there is data that has been sent from the info you have just sent without realising.

Logging in will log the email used (most likely with a uuid which is a unique user ID). A UUID is just like a numberplate.

- its completely unique to you and only you
- they are never the same.

What could I learn better from this?

I feel even though I have the understanding of what a database is, I severely struggle writing things into code, if I am given a task, I am clueless on how to start without any kind of help of knowing what it is I am doing to begin with.

I get distracted super easily from almost anything even if it's something I enjoy doing in my day to day life. This can be gaming, listening to music or studying etc. To improve this I have tried isolating myself from other ways I could get distracted such as simply working in a new environment, making sure I can be in some form of a "zenned" state when working, making sure I'm staying hydrated and many more things as simple as going to pet my cat every so often.

I feel my weaknesses when learning is that I am a terrible independant learner and struggle facing most tasks given to me unless I am working alongisde people, this can be pairs or groups. If groups are too big (anything above 6 people for me) in one place, I feel there will be too much communication where something will be misunderstood which has happened quite frequently in some points in general life.



SQL
What is SQL?

SQL (I say it as Sequel) is a very simplified language when it comes to programming, It's used to organise and obtain data from a specific aspect/table. A very helpful scenario of this can be that you are given a table that you need to analyze and make sure the data is correct but there are thousands of rows and columns with different data inside of it. A way of using SQL can be to specify and ask what data you want and where you would like to display it.

For instance, you would SELECT * FROM COLUMNNAMEHERE. this is the same way as saying "I want you to give me all the data from x part (X being the column name). It is very simplified and easy to understand code.

Like all languages, it has challenge to it and is difficult to understand in certain situations. Personally I always over think on what I need to tell it to do instead of writing it. Something as simple as getting all names in a table with the name Peter for example. Until I had it written out I would think about 3 lines of code i'd need to right to get this done and not in a simple format at all. instead it was meerly "display all rows with the name peter" and not all the if's, and's or variables.

I am a very hands on person and if something is interactive such as the websites we use for introducing to code, I enjoy those a lot as it gives you a selection of things to use instead of the answer being something I would need to think of, if I am given the option to select from a list of options rather than "what do i need to right myself?" I will think logically behind each one. This does not apply to just SQL either, this is for almost every aspect we have learnt thus far on SOC.

Something I do not understand at all is API's and how they work, I would not be able to really describe what one is without having asked someone else each time. Despite having a hackathon done for it I struggle to explain what it is aside from the resources we have already been given.

A way of learning things faster is I feel i need to take more notes on my code generally, I am however being told that my notes are too long for code as I understand they are meant to be short and simple to know what it does, but to me it does not explain the meaning of something well at all for it to set in, I typically do intense observation so I can say something with as much detail as I can even if it's for a "short" note. This then leaves me not understanding something as much as I'm also not a very good note taker as it is.


API Defenition (From GPT)

An API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, is like a bridge that allows different software applications to talk to each other.

Imagine you are at a restaurant. You (the user) look at the menu and decide what you want. You then tell the waiter (the API) your order. The waiter takes your order to the kitchen (the system) where the food is prepared. Once it's ready, the waiter brings the food back to you.

In this analogy:

You are the user or application that wants to access data or functionality.
The waiter is the API, taking your request and bringing you the result.
The kitchen is the system or server that processes the request and provides the desired data or service.
APIs allow different software systems to interact smoothly without needing to understand the details of how each other works. For example, a weather app on your phone uses an API to get the latest weather data from a weather service.
------------------

From this, it seems that it is a way of multiple applications at once can communicate and function as a whole rather than checking on things separately each time.


Things I would like to improve on:

- Knowing what to actually write down when starting any kind of task without the need of asking for help right at the begginning
- Understand what questions I should be asking as I am not good with asking any questions unless its something I am super passionate about such as hobbies that I have done for years at minimum.
- Note taking - I am not really good with note taking as I tend to throw myself by thinking too much how I should word the note rather than right it down and explain more of it later.
- Rubber Duck method - Explained by my mentor, get something to talk my process through to.

How can I improve these?

- With regards to knowing how to start, I am not too sure on what to do for this as of present as it's something I have commonly struggled with in general not just on SOC
- Do a bit of extra research to fully grasp my understanding of a subject with the correct questions to then ask
- Take notes down in a brief quick manor then worry about the more detail part later

Some important notes I have taken down from my mentor:

- Meaning of "Let" - Used to store data of a value/intergar/value/string etc.

- Use open AI for HELP FIDINING MEANINGS NOT ANSWER

- try to keep numbers out of the picture when defining names on code.

- In some languages, functions can be priv or pub, what defines access rights when looking from out perspective. if there is code in 1 file and code in the other.

- When using any code, typically when locating mp3, mp4 and other file types, you want to use "src="

- The starter code for html and for other languages is called a boilerplate

- industry github, you work separate branches, you create pull request to the master, ppl make review on it then approve it.

- === compares variable and type

- "const =" constant variable and cannot change. Imagine it as a READ ONLY Variable

- Node is more of an Extension for Javascript (Frameworks are usually extensions but have bounderies on how you should work with them)

- Postman is basically live server but for json/node files

- Dynamic page is where a page does not load everything at once.

Going forward I am continuing to take notes a bit more effectively in better detail from my mentor and will continue to do so.
